# Star Wars Movie Survey Data Cleaning and Analysis

## Overview

This project involves data cleaning and analysis of a Star Wars movie survey dataset. The dataset contains responses from individuals about their viewing habits, preferences, and rankings of the Star Wars films. The goal was to clean the data, extract meaningful insights, and provide an organized overview of the findings.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Cleaning

The cleaning process ensured the dataset was consistent, accurate, and ready for analysis. Steps included:

- **Handling Missing Data:** Removed or imputed missing values where applicable.
- **Standardizing Columns:** Renamed columns for clarity and consistency.
- **Removing Outliers:** Identified and removed outliers to prevent skewed results.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Transformed textual responses (e.g., "Yes"/"No") into Boolean values.



### 2. Film Rankings

Each respondent ranked the Star Wars films. To analyze these rankings:

- Calculated the average ranking for each movie.
- Identified trends such as the most and least popular films based on average rankings.
- Visualized the rankings using bar charts.

### 3. View Counts

To analyze viewership:

- Determined the number of respondents who had seen each movie.
- Analyzed trends in viewership across different Star Wars episodes.

## Insights Gained

- **Popular Films:** Identified which films were most highly rated by respondents.
- **Viewership Trends:** Observed variations in viewership, such as differences between older and newer films.
- **Demographic Preferences:** Uncovered any notable differences in rankings or viewership among different demographic groups (e.g., age, gender).

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas:** For data cleaning and handling missing values.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** To organize and document the workflow.
